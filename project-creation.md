# 3. Creating a new project

To define and deploy a business process, we first need to create a new project in which we can store the BPMN2 model, our domain model and the forms required for user interaction. To create a new project:

1. Navigate to {business_central}

2. Login to the platform with the provided username and password.

3. Click on **Design** to navigate to the Design perspective.

4. In the Design perspective, create a new project. If your space is empty, this can be done by clicking on the blue **Add Project** button in the center of the page. If you already have projects in your space, you can click on the blue **Add Project** icon at the top right of the page.

5. Give the project the name `loan-approval`, and the description "Loan Approval Process".

   With the project created, we can now start building our solution.
